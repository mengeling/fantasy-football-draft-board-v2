# Justfile Task Runner Guide

This guide explains how to use the `justfile` task runner for managing your Fantasy Football Draft Board deployment and operations.

## üéØ What is Justfile?

`justfile` is a modern task runner that's like `make` but simpler and more powerful. It allows you to define tasks in a clean, readable format and run them with simple commands.

### **Benefits:**

- **Simple syntax** - Easy to read and write
- **Built-in help** - Run `just --list` to see all commands
- **Parameter support** - Pass arguments to tasks
- **Cross-platform** - Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **No dependencies** - Single binary, no complex setup

## üöÄ Installation

### **On Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
# Install just
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash

# Add to PATH (if not already added)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### **On macOS:**

```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install just

# Or using the installer
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash
```

### **On Windows:**

## üîÑ CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow uses justfile commands:

### **Development Deployment**

```yaml
- name: Deploy to development
  run: just ci-deploy-dev
```

### **Production Deployment**

```yaml
- name: Deploy to production
  run: just ci-deploy-prod
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### **Adding New Commands**

To add a new command, edit the `justfile`:

```makefile
# Your new command
my-command:
    echo "This is my custom command"
    # Add your commands here
```

### **Parameters**

Commands can accept parameters:

```bash
# Command with parameter
just ssl mydomain.com

# Command with optional parameter
just logs backend
```

### **Dependencies**

Commands can depend on other commands:

```makefile
deploy-and-test: deploy
    just test
```

## üé® Tips & Best Practices

### **1. Use Help**

```bash
# See all commands
just --list

# See command details
just --show deploy
```

### **2. Use Parameters**

```bash
# Instead of hardcoding values
just deploy fantasyfootball.com
just logs backend
just update-service frontend
```

### **3. Chain Commands**

```bash
# Run multiple commands
just deploy && just health
```

### **4. Use Aliases**

You can create aliases in your shell:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias deploy='just deploy'
alias status='just status'
alias logs='just logs'
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Command not found**

   ```bash
   # Install just
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Permission denied**

   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the right directory
   cd /path/to/fantasy-football-draft-board-v2
   ```

3. **Docker not running**
   ```bash
   # Start Docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

### **Getting Help**

```bash
# Show all commands
just --list

# Show command help
just --show <command>

# Show this guide
cat JUSTFILE_GUIDE.md
```

## üéâ Benefits Over Multiple Scripts

### **Before (Multiple Scripts):**

- 8+ shell scripts to remember
- Different syntax and behavior
- Hard to maintain
- Confusing which script to use

### **After (Justfile):**

- **One file** with all commands
- **Consistent syntax** and behavior
- **Built-in help** (`just --list`)
- **Easy to maintain** and extend
- **Clear organization** by category

Your deployment process is now much cleaner and more maintainable!
